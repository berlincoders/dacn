This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## swiper modifications
-  Control the slider height using Tailwind.
-  Make it responsive (so it looks good on all screen sizes).
-  Slow down the autoplay so it doesn‚Äôt feel too fast.
-  Ensure images fill the Swiper correctly using object-cover and size utilities.
-  Responsive captions or text on top of the slider
```bash
     <SwiperSlide>
        <div className="relative w-full h-full">
          <Image
            src="/images/slide1.webp"
            alt="Slide 1"
            fill
            className="object-cover"
            priority
          />
          <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/40 flex items-center justify-center">
            <h2 className="text-white text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-center px-4">
              Welcome to Our World üåç
            </h2>
          </div>
        </div>
      </SwiperSlide>
```
## "active link highlighting" effect
- Use usePathname from next/navigation,This [hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) tells you what the current URL path is.
- We loop through all your nav links and conditionally apply classes based on whether the current path matches
-If it's active, we apply text-yellow-400 bg-gray-800,Otherwise, it stays white with a hover effect
